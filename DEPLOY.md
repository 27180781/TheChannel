# Deployment

Operator notes for running TheChannel. The reference deployment is CapRover with
the database as its own app; `docker-compose.yml` in this repo describes a
different, single-host layout and is **not** what CapRover uses — see
[The `/app/files` trap](#the-appfiles-trap) for why that difference matters.

CapRover builds from `captain-definition`, which points at the `Dockerfile`.
Changing an environment variable restarts the container with the **existing**
image; it does not rebuild. New code requires a Deploy, not a restart.

---

## 1. The database app

The backend reaches the database purely through environment variables, so the
database living in its own app is a configuration fact and needs no code change.

| Variable | Value on CapRover |
|---|---|
| `REDIS_ADDR` | `srv-captain--<dbapp>:6666` — exactly one address, see below |
| `REDIS_PROTOCOL` | `tcp` |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | only if the database requires one |
| `REDIS_MASTER` | leave unset — Redis Sentinel is not supported, see below |

`srv-captain--<appname>` is how CapRover apps reach each other on the internal
network. `6666` is Apache Kvrocks' default port — `kvrocks.conf` in this repo
sets no `port` line, so the default applies. If you changed it, use your value.

**`REDIS_PROTOCOL` must be `tcp`.** Note that `sample.env` shows

```
REDIS_ADDR=/app/data/kvrocks.sock
REDIS_PROTOCOL=unix
```

That is correct only for the docker-compose layout, where both containers share
a volume. A unix socket cannot cross container boundaries, so copying those two
lines into a CapRover setup with a separate database app cannot work. The code
defaults `REDIS_PROTOCOL` to `tcp` when unset, but an explicitly wrong value is
fatal at boot. The log line to look for is
`Session store init failed (REDIS_PROTOCOL="unix", REDIS_ADDR="srv-captain--<dbapp>:6666"): dial unix srv-captain--<dbapp>:6666: connect: no such file or directory`
(the session store is the only client that honours `REDIS_PROTOCOL`; the
go-redis clients pick the network from the address themselves).

**One address only — no Sentinel, no cluster.** `REDIS_ADDR` (singular) is a
single `host:port` or socket path. The session store (`redistore`, in
`backend/main.go`) dials that string verbatim: it cannot follow a Sentinel
master and cannot take a comma-separated address list, even though the go-redis
clients could. Rather than let the session store silently talk to a different
server than the rest of the backend, the backend refuses to boot when
`REDIS_MASTER` is set or `REDIS_ADDR` contains a comma, and logs a line saying
which of the two it objected to. Run one Kvrocks/Redis instance and point
`REDIS_ADDR` at it.

### Verify the database has a persistent volume

The database app must have a persistent directory mapped to its data directory
(`/var/lib/kvrocks` for Kvrocks). Without it, every channel, message, role and
setting is destroyed on the next redeploy of the **database** app.

In CapRover: open the database app → App Configs → Persistent Directories, and
confirm one is mapped to the data path. If the list is empty, add it before you
put anything real in the system.

## 2. Cloudflare R2 (file storage)

Set all four of these, or R2 stays off entirely and files are written to local
disk:

| Variable | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare dashboard → R2 → Account ID (right-hand panel) |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | R2 → Manage API Tokens → Create API Token |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | shown once, alongside the Access Key ID |
| `R2_BUCKET_NAME` | the bucket you created |

The token must have **Object Read & Write** permission and its scope must
include the bucket. A read-only or wrongly scoped token authenticates fine and
then fails every upload with `AccessDenied` — see [Diagnosing an upload
failure](#diagnosing-an-upload-failure).

**Take the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, not the token value.** The
create-token page shows a `cfat_…` token first and the S3 credential pair below
it. The `cfat_` token is a Cloudflare REST API bearer token and is not used by
this application, which speaks the S3 protocol.

### `R2_PUBLIC_URL` — optional, and usually leave it unset

| Unset (recommended) | Set |
|---|---|
| The backend issues a pre-signed URL valid for one hour and redirects the browser to it. The bucket stays private. | The backend redirects to the public bucket URL. |

A public bucket URL is readable by anyone who has the link, **regardless of the
channel's "require authentication to view files" setting**. Setting this
silently overrides that privacy choice for every channel on the platform. Leave
it unset unless you specifically want a public CDN.

No Cloudflare Worker is required in either mode.

### Migrating files that already exist

Blobs written while R2 was off are on local disk only. A one-shot migration
copies them into the bucket on the first boot after R2 is configured. Its log
lines look like:

```
migrations: running 2026-08-local-files-to-r2
migrations: local-files-to-R2: 12 uploaded, 0 already in R2, 0 missing locally, 0 malformed, 0 failed, out of 12 file records across 3 channels
migrations: 2026-08-local-files-to-r2 completed
```

`0 failed` and `completed` together mean it is done. Anything else leaves the
migration **unmarked**, so it continues on the next boot — a failed or partial
run costs nothing and loses nothing.

Each migration gets its own budget of **2 minutes per boot** (`migrationBudget`
in `backend/migrations.go`), so a slow one cannot eat the time of the ones after
it. A run that hits its budget stops where it is and is **not** marked applied.
The R2 copy records every blob it has already uploaded in the Redis set
`migrations:r2-copied`, so the next boot only processes what is left rather
than starting over, and a large corpus finishes across a few restarts. Expect
`migrations: running 2026-08-local-files-to-r2` on each of those boots until the
`completed` line appears.

Local copies are never deleted, and a file the migration has not reached yet is
still served from disk, so switching R2 on cannot break historical images.

## 3. Environment variables

### Required

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `SERVER_PORT` | The port the backend listens on. There is no default — leaving it unset binds an arbitrary port and nothing can reach the app. |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Signs session cookies. Required: an empty value is a fatal boot error. Use a random string of at least 32 bytes (`openssl rand -hex 32`); a shorter key logs `WARNING: SECRET_KEY is only N bytes` on every start. Changing it invalidates every active session and logs everyone out. |
| `REDIS_ADDR` | See [The database app](#1-the-database-app). |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth. Sign-in is the only way in, so without these nobody can log in. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | |
| `ADMIN_USERS` | Comma-separated emails granted super-admin. Without at least one, no one can reach the super-admin panel. |

### Optional

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `REDIS_PROTOCOL` | `tcp` | Must be `tcp` for a separate database app. |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | empty | |
| `REDIS_MASTER` | unset | **Must stay unset.** Redis Sentinel is not supported, and neither is a cluster given as a comma-separated `REDIS_ADDR`: the session store dials `REDIS_ADDR` as one plain address. With either set, the backend refuses to start and logs why. See [The database app](#1-the-database-app). |
| `ROOT_STATIC_FOLDER` | `/usr/share/ng` | Where the built frontend is served from. The Dockerfile already puts it there. |
| `COOKIE_INSECURE` | unset | Set to `1` **only** for local plain-HTTP development. Unset, the session cookie is marked `Secure` and will not survive a non-HTTPS origin. |
| `R2_*` | unset | See [Cloudflare R2](#2-cloudflare-r2-file-storage). |
| `SKIP_MIGRATIONS` | unset | `1` skips all data migrations at boot. An escape hatch, not a normal setting. |
| `MIGRATION_APPLY_AUTH_FLAGS` | unset | `1` makes the **first** features backfill honour leftover `require_auth`, `require_auth_for_view_files` and `count_views` settings values. Only that migration reads it: once it is recorded as applied (every deployment that has booted this code once), setting the flag does nothing and nothing says so. The v2 backfill ignores it. Off by default because those keys are no longer in the owner UI, so applying them would restrict channels in a way their owners cannot see or undo. |
| `ALLOW_LEGACY_UNSCOPED_FILES` | unset | `true` lets file records with no owning channel be served from any channel. This reopens a cross-tenant read path and exists only as a temporary escape hatch during a backfill. |
| `PPROF_ADDR` | unset | e.g. `localhost:6060` to enable the Go profiler. Never expose it publicly. |
| `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE` | unset | Unset, channel webhooks may only reach public addresses; a private, loopback, link-local or carrier-grade-NAT target is refused and logged as `webhook: refusing to connect to non-public address`. `1` lifts that check. Because `webhook_url` is set by channel owners, `1` reopens SSRF from any owner against your internal network (loopback, `169.254.169.254`, internal services) — use it only on a platform whose channel owners are all trusted, never on a self-service one. |

## 4. The reverse proxy must pass the client address

Rate limits, the failed-login budget and the per-client cap on live event
streams (100 concurrent `/events` connections per client) are all keyed by
the session e-mail or, for anonymous viewers, by the address the backend
sees. The backend trusts `X-Real-IP` for that, so the proxy in front of it
must set it from the connection (the shipped `Caddyfile` does:
`header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}` plus `header_up -True-Client-IP`;
CapRover's nginx sets it by default). Behind a proxy that does not, every
anonymous viewer shares the proxy's address: the 101st viewer platform-wide
is refused with 429 and one abusive visitor's failed logins lock out everyone.

## 5. The `/app/files` trap

With R2 off, uploads are written to `/app/files/` inside the container.

`docker-compose.yml` maps `./channel_data:/app/files`, which makes that path
durable — but **CapRover does not use docker-compose**. It builds from
`captain-definition` and the `Dockerfile`, and mounts no volume there unless you
add one explicitly. So on a default CapRover deployment every uploaded file
lands in the container's writable layer and is destroyed on the next deploy, and
the upload fails outright if that layer is full or read-only.

Either configure R2, or add a persistent directory mapped to `/app/files` in the
backend app's App Configs. R2 is the better answer: it also survives running
more than one backend replica, which a local directory does not.

---

## 6. Diagnosing an upload failure

An upload returning 500 logs the reason. Find the line beginning `uploadFile:`:

```
uploadFile: raam: R2 upload of file 8759a37 failed (bucket "arootz",
key files/0d/fb/0dfb51…, 31126 bytes, content-type image/jpeg):
… api error AccessDenied: Access Denied
```

The S3 error code at the end is the diagnosis:

| Code | Cause |
|---|---|
| `AccessDenied` | The token authenticated but cannot write — created read-only, or scoped to a different bucket. |
| `NoSuchBucket` | `R2_BUCKET_NAME` or `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` is wrong. |
| `InvalidAccessKeyId` | `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` is wrong. |
| `SignatureDoesNotMatch` | `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` is wrong. |

Do not change variables before reading this line — all four failures look
identical from the browser, which only ever sees a 500.

### Telling where a file was served from

A request to `/api/channel/<slug>/files/<id>` answers:

- **302** with a tiny body — redirected to R2 (pre-signed, or the public URL).
- **200** with the file's real size and the log line
  `serveFile: … not in R2 …, serving local copy` — served from local disk.
- **200** with the log line `serveFile: presign failed for … : <error>` — the
  file **is** in R2, but the backend could not sign a URL and is proxying the
  object through itself. Fix the R2 credentials or the clock; do not re-upload.

A browser showing the image proves neither; the status code does.

---

## 7. Boot log checklist

A healthy start prints, in order:

```
Connection to DB successful!
R2 storage enabled (bucket: <name>)        # absent when R2 is off, which is a valid state
migrations: running <id>                    # only for migrations not yet applied
migrations: <id> completed
```

`migrations: channel features backfill touched N of M channels` (first boot of
this code) or `migrations: channel features backfill v2 touched N of M channels`
(an instance upgraded after the first backfill already ran) should report an
`M` matching your real channel count. If it does not, stop and investigate
before continuing — the migrations are one-shot.
